## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to campaign spending and electoral performance. Basically, I want to investigate if higher campaign spending actually correlates with more electoral success. Using the data from the FEC, I will be able to analyze the relation. Lastly, through data visualization and regression analysis, this project will be able to accurately inform me if campaign spending and electoral performance are positively correlated.
